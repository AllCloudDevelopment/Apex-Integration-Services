# Salesforce Bulk API

* The Bulk API provides a programmatic option to load org data into Salesforce.  It is based on REST principles and is optimized for loading or deleting large sets of data.  You can use it to query, queryAll, insert, update, upsert, or delete many records asynchronously by submitting batches. Salesforce processes batches in the background.
* The easiest way to use Bulk API is to enable it for processing records in Data Loader using CSV files. Using Data Loader avoids the need to write your own client application.
