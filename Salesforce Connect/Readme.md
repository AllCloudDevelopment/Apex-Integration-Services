# Salesforce Connect
* Use Salesforce Connect (formerly called Lightning Connect) as a data proxy to pull OData or other data sources into Salesforce on demand. 
* No data is copied to the Salesforce database. 
* Run endpoints that expose OData 2.0 on Heroku or as provided by external systems. 
* [Salesforce Connect custom adapters](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_connector_custom_adapter.htm) allow Salesforce to proxy any data source that Apex can talk to, including REST with XML or JSON and SOAP.
